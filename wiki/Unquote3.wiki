#summary Plans for unquote 3.0.0, the next major release

= Introduction =

It's been over two years since the last release of Unquote. Partly because it is version 2.2.2 is very stable, partly because breaking changes in vs2012 and F# 3.0 delayed value in upgrading from vs2010 and F# 2.0. However, things have stabilized around vs2013 and F# 3.1, so we are due for some new bits!

= Planned Features =

The following are the main features planned for Unquote 3.0.0.
  # (breaking change) Drop support for Silverlight4.
  # Add support for net45 and portable profile 259 (upgrade main solution and projects to vs2013 / F# 3.1)
  # Continue support for net40 (maintain secondary vs2010 solution file and projects)
  # (breaking change) Deprecate '?' suffixed operators (they conflict with F# 3.1 nullable operators) and replace with '!' suffixed operators
  # Add xUnit.net 2.x integration
  # Add Fuchu integration

= TODO =
  * (out of scope) Possibly do better automating testing, building, and packing with fake
  * (no - can have issues) Possibly add FSharp.Core dependencies in NuGet package
