	<summary>Write F# unit test assertions as quoted expressions, get step-by-step failure messages for free.</summary>
    <description>Unquote is not just another DSL or API for making unit test assertions. Instead, assertions are written as plain, statically-checked F# quoted expressions and test failure messages are given as step-by-step F# expression evaluations.

Unquote integrates configuration-free with all exception-based unit testing frameworks including xUnit.net, NUnit, and MbUnit. Unquote may even be used within FSI sessions, enabling the direct migration of ad-hoc FSI tests during interactive development to formal test suites.

In addition to its unit testing features, Unquote includes operators for evaluating, decompiling, and incrementally reducing quoted expressions.</description>
